# Simple weather app around needing a jacket and umbrella

This is mainly a proof of concept weather app. This does not utilize all functions of the weather api used. Inspired by the ios app brella.

Utilizes weather API for simple current weather info and procesess it to recommend 
(or not recommend) a jacket and an umbrella.

The code is simple and I look forward to optimizing it as I have time. 

If you wish to run it on your own npm local server, please be sure to include a .env file with your api link and key. The variables look like this:
REACT_APP_API_URL="https://api.weatherapi.com/v1"
REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY="1234567890yourapikeyhere"
